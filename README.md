Nest Stash is a powerful multi-driver caching module for NestJS that provides a clean, unified API for managing application cache across different storage backends. Inspired by the flexibility of frameworks like Laravel, it allows developers to switch seamlessly between cache drivers—such as in-memory, Redis, and other supported stores—without changing the way they interact with the cache layer.

By centralizing caching logic, Nest Stash makes it easy to boost application performance, reduce redundant database queries, and optimize response times. It is designed with extensibility in mind, giving you the ability to plug in custom drivers if your use case goes beyond the built-in options.
